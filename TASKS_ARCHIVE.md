# TASKS_ARCHIVE.md — DevBrain Completed Phases

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Project System ✅ COMPLETE

### Environment Setup
- [x] Scaffold Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [x] Apply design tokens from Claude Design file into Tailwind config
- [x] Set up Docker Compose: PostgreSQL (pgvector:pg16 on port 5433), Ollama, app server
- [x] Configure NVIDIA GPU passthrough in docker-compose.yml for RTX 2060 Max-Q
- [x] Pull Ollama models: `mistral:7b`, `nomic-embed-text` (gemma3:4b optional)
- [x] Verify GPU is used — mistral at ~47 t/s, full model in VRAM (4.66 GB / 6 GB)
- [x] Set up Express + TypeScript server with tsx watch
- [x] Set up environment config with dotenv + Zod validation (lib/env.ts)
- [x] Implement local JWT auth (bcrypt + jsonwebtoken) — multi-user RBAC, LDAP optional, audit log

### Database Schema
- [x] Create `projects` table with all fields including `color`, `status`, `tech_stack[]`, `type`
- [x] Create `documents` table + `document_chunks` table with pgvector `embedding VECTOR(768)` column
- [x] Create `issues` table with `investigation_steps` (JSONB) + `notes` (JSONB)
- [x] Create `commands` table with `tsv` full-text index and `is_favorite`, `last_used`
- [x] Create `releases` table with `features/fixes/breaking_changes TEXT[]`
- [x] Create `runbooks` table with `steps` (JSONB) — schema ready, route in Phase 7
- [x] Enable pgvector extension: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`
- [x] Create HNSW index on `document_chunks.embedding` (m=16, ef_construction=64)
- [x] Write migration scripts (setup-db.mjs, migrate-tasks-devbrain.mjs, migrate-releases.mjs)

### Project Seeding (runs on first launch)
- [x] Build `server/db/seed.ts` — checks if projects table empty, inserts SEED_PROJECTS
- [x] Seed all 5 projects: PlayCru, WealthView Pro, Memex, DevBrain, Music Player with correct colors + stack
- [x] Seed starter commands for all projects via migrate-tasks-devbrain.mjs (10 DevBrain commands)

- [x] Skip non-checkbox lines (headings, prose, tables)
- [x] Return summary: `{ created: N, skipped: N }` — skip exact title duplicates (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)
- [x] "Import from Markdown" button in Tasks page header → file picker (`.md` only) → calls endpoint → shows result toast

---

## Phase 8 — Search & Dashboard ✅ COMPLETE

### Global Search (⌘K)
- [x] Upgrade Ctrl+K palette (currently commands-only) to search across all types
- [x] Search simultaneously across: docs, issues, commands, releases, runbooks

- [x] Keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet modal (`?` key)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop for investigation steps and runbook steps (dnd-kit) — skipped (HTML5 DnD already works)
- [x] Confirm dialog for destructive actions — delete confirm modal on projects; cascade warning text included

### Settings Page
- [x] Export all data as JSON (full backup) — `GET /api/settings/backup`, browser download via blob URL
- [ ] Import data from JSON backup — skipped (complex, risky for v1)
- [x] Re-seed projects (with confirmation) — via Settings page + existing Projects page button
- [x] AI config — shows backend (ollama/claude), chat model, embed model, Ollama URL

### Auth
- [x] Implement local JWT auth (jsonwebtoken) — single user v1, 30-day token in localStorage
- [x] Protect all API routes behind `requireAuth` middleware — unprotected: `/api/health`, `/api/auth/*`
- [x] Login page with password — centered branded form, error state, auto-redirect on success
- [x] `AUTH_PASSWORD` env var optional — when unset, dev mode (no auth gate, auto-issue token)

### Data Integrity
- [x] Cascade delete warnings: delete confirm modal warns all project data will be deleted
- [x] Content hash deduplication already live for documents ✓

---

## Phase 10 — Search & AI Upgrades ✅ COMPLETE

### Hybrid Search (⌘K upgrade)
- [x] Docs: pgvector cosine similarity on `document_chunks.embedding` → DISTINCT ON doc, re-sort by distance
- [x] Issues: `tsvector @@ plainto_tsquery` with `ts_rank`, fallback to ILIKE when no FTS match
- [x] Commands: same tsvector + fallback pattern
- [x] Releases / Runbooks: keep ILIKE (no tsv column)
- [x] Empty query: show recent items per type instead of nothing
- [x] Graceful Ollama fallback: if embedding fails, fall back to tsvector/ILIKE for docs

### Activity Feed (Dashboard)
- [x] `GET /api/dashboard` — add `activity` array: UNION ALL across docs/issues/commands/releases/runbooks
- [x] Return type, id, label, project_name, project_color, created_at — last 15 items ordered by created_at DESC
- [x] Dashboard UI: new "Recent Activity" section — icon per type, relative timestamp, project dot

### Pagination
- [x] `GET /api/documents` — accept `limit` (default 25, max 100) + `offset`; return `{ items, total }` 
- [x] `GET /api/issues` — same pagination shape
- [x] `GET /api/commands` — same pagination shape
- [x] Documents page: "Load more" button, appends next page; reset on filter/project change
- [x] Issues list: same "Load more" pattern
- [x] Commands list: same "Load more" pattern

### AI: Related Issues
- [x] `GET /api/issues/related?q=text` — tsvector `plainto_tsquery` with `ts_rank`, top 3 results
- [x] New Issue modal: debounced (400ms) title lookup after ≥3 chars, show "Similar issues" inline

### Loading Skeletons
- [x] `Skeleton.tsx` component — animated gray shimmer bar, configurable width/height
- [x] Documents page: skeleton rows while loading
- [x] Issues list: skeleton rows while loading
- [x] Commands list: skeleton rows while loading

---

## Phase 11 — AI Power Features, Integrations & UX Completion ✅ COMPLETE

### AI: Issue Intelligence
- [x] Auto-generate runbook from resolved issue — "Save as Runbook" button on a resolved issue; maps `investigation_steps` → runbook steps, pre-fills title + tags, opens in Runbooks page
- [x] Smart command suggestions on issue detail — sidebar panel shows top 5 semantically related commands (pgvector on issue title + description vs command title + description embeddings)
- [x] Issue embeddings — store `nomic-embed-text` embedding on each issue (create/update); needed for command suggestion similarity

### AI: Release Intelligence
- [x] `POST /api/releases/:id/qa` — Q&A over a single release's features/fixes/breaking-changes/notes via Ollama
- [x] `POST /api/releases/compare` — "What changed between v1.x and v2.x?" across two releases; generates a diff summary via Ollama
- [x] Releases page UI — "Ask about this release" input field per release card; "Compare releases" picker in header

### Integrations
- [x] GitHub commit import — `POST /api/releases/import-git` accepts raw `git log --oneline` text (already partially supported); add structured `git log --pretty=format:"%h %s"` parser and optional GitHub API fetch by repo + tag range
- [x] JSON backup import — `POST /api/settings/import` accepts a backup JSON file; dry-run mode shows what would be created; skips duplicates (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING); returns `{ created, skipped }` summary
- [x] Import UI in Settings page — file picker for `.json` backup files, progress indicator, result toast

### UX Completion
- [x] Document tags on upload — tag input in DropZone; chips rendered before upload; cleared on submit; passed to both file upload and URL import
- [x] Release → Issue navigation — linked_issues rendered as accent chips in ReleaseCard; click dispatches `devbrain:navigate` + `devbrain:open-issue` events; App.tsx routes to Issues; IssuesPage opens the issue
- [x] Issues bulk actions — checkbox per row + select-all header; bulk toolbar (Mark Resolved, Won't Fix, Delete with confirm); clears on filter/load
- [x] Commands bulk import — "↑ Import" button in header; accepts `.sh`/`.bash`/`.zshrc`; parses `# comment\ncommand` blocks; creates one command per block; success toast with count
- [x] Runbooks page — "✓" Mark as Used button added to each list card; calls API and updates last_used_at inline without navigating to detail

### Org Mode (v2 foundation)
- [x] Multi-user auth — role-based: viewer / editor / admin per project; `users` + `project_members` tables; backward-compatible JWT migration; first-run auto-creates admin from AUTH_PASSWORD
- [x] LDAP/SSO integration — optional, env-var driven (`LDAP_URL` etc.); dynamic import of ldapjs (graceful no-op if not installed); binds as user to verify password
- [x] Shared command library — personal namespace + team namespace per command; filter chips (👥 Team / 🔒 Personal) in sidebar; namespace field in create modal; personal badge on card; server filters by namespace + user
- [x] Audit log — `audit_events` table; `logAudit()` non-fatal service; all user/project mutations logged; `GET /api/audit` (admin only) with filters; AuditLog component in Settings (admin only, paginated)

---

## Phase 12 — Integrations & Platform Expansion ✅ COMPLETE

### Git Integration
- [x] `POST /api/git/:id/repo` — store repo URL + optional GitHub PAT (AES-256-GCM encrypted in DB)
- [x] `GET /api/git/:id/commits` — fetch recent commits via GitHub API
- [x] `GET /api/git/:id/compare` — commits between two refs (for release auto-populate)
- [x] Commit list widget on per-project dashboard — SHA, message, author, date; link to GitHub
- [x] "Link commit" action on issue detail — attach a commit SHA to an issue (`linked_commits TEXT[]`)
- [x] `POST /api/issues/:id/commits` + `DELETE` — append/remove SHA; chips in issue detail
- [x] PR link support — store PR URL on issue (`pr_url TEXT`); open in browser on click

### Jira / Linear Sync
- [x] Settings: Jira config section — base URL, email, API token (AES-256-GCM, stored in `app_settings`)
- [x] Settings: Linear config section — API key (encrypted)
- [x] `POST /api/integrations/jira/preview` + `/import` — JQL query, maps priority/status
- [x] `POST /api/integrations/linear/preview` + `/import` — GraphQL team query
- [x] Import modal in Issues page — source (Jira / Linear), JQL/team key, max results, import

### Progressive Web App (PWA / Offline)
- [x] `vite-plugin-pwa` — generates service worker + web manifest
- [x] Workbox NetworkFirst caching for key API routes (projects, commands, releases, runbooks)
- [x] Offline banner — yellow strip when `navigator.onLine === false`
- [x] App manifest — name, icons, theme `#0A0A0F`, display standalone

### Cloud / Multi-Device Hosting
- [x] `docker-compose.prod.yml` — Caddy + app + postgres; required secrets validated at start
- [x] `Caddyfile` — reverse proxy to app, gzip, security headers, static asset caching

## Phase 13 — Security Hardening ✅ COMPLETE

### Authentication & Token Security
- [x] Rate-limit `/api/auth/login` — `express-rate-limit`: max 10 attempts per 15 min per IP; return 429 with `Retry-After` header
- [x] Remove legacy token admin fallback — tokens missing `userId` must return 401, not grant admin; force re-login
- [x] Add `iss` and `aud` claims to JWT signing and verification — prevents tokens from other services being accepted
- [x] Move JWT from localStorage to HttpOnly cookie — eliminates XSS token theft; update `requireAuth` to read from cookie; keep `Authorization` header as fallback for API clients
- [x] Fix timing attack on login — run `bcrypt.compare` even when user is not found (compare against a dummy hash) so response time doesn't leak username existence

### Authorization & Audit
- [x] Audit log: add `logAudit()` to `POST /api/auth/change-password` — password changes must be visible in audit trail
- [x] Admin password reset confirmation — require admin to re-enter their own password before resetting another user's; add `logAudit()` with `action: 'update'` on the affected user
- [x] Add HTTPS enforcement option — env var `FORCE_HTTPS=true` adds HSTS header + HTTP→HTTPS redirect middleware; document in `.env.example`

### Input & SQL Safety
- [x] Replace `Object.keys(updates)` with explicit column allowlists in all dynamic `PUT`/`PATCH` handlers — `commands.ts`, `documents.ts`, `issues.ts`, `users.ts`; use a `const UPDATABLE_COLS = new Set([...])` guard before building the `SET` clause
- [x] Fix manual SQL parameter index counting — replaced with `buildSetClause(cols, vals)` helper in `server/lib/db.ts`; used across commands, documents, issues, users
- [x] SSRF protection on URL document import — validate that the resolved host is not a private/loopback IP (`10.x`, `192.168.x`, `172.16–31.x`, `127.x`, `::1`) before fetching; return 422 with clear error

### Infrastructure Secrets
- [x] Move Docker Compose credentials to env file — replaced hardcoded `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`/`POSTGRES_USER`/`DATABASE_URL` with `${VAR:-default}` references; `JWT_SECRET` now required (no default); documented in `.env.example`
- [x] Add resource limits to Docker Compose — postgres capped at 512 MB / 1 CPU; app at 1 GB / 2 CPU

---

## Phase 14 — Architecture & Code Quality ✅ COMPLETE
> Baseline review scores: Architecture **5/10**, Code **5/10**. Structural debt that compounds with every feature added.

### Routing — Replace Custom Event System with React Router
- [x] Install `react-router-dom` v6 — wrap `App` in `<BrowserRouter>`
- [x] Map all current routes to URL paths: `/`, `/projects`, `/documents`, `/chat`, `/issues`, `/commands`, `/releases`, `/runbooks`, `/tasks`, `/settings`
- [x] Add project scoping to URLs — dropped in favour of `?project=:id` which achieves the same UX goal (refresh/history) without a full router restructure
- [x] Replace `window.dispatchEvent('devbrain:navigate')` with `useNavigate()` — remove all custom event listeners from `App.tsx`
- [x] Replace `window.dispatchEvent('devbrain:open-issue')` with URL param: `/issues?open=:id` — `IssuesPage` uses `useSearchParams`; `Releases.tsx` now calls `navigate('/issues?open=' + id)`
- [x] Persist selected project in URL (`?project=:id`) — `App.tsx` reads on mount; `ProjectSwitcher` updates URL on pick; `setRoute` preserves param across navigation
- [x] Add `<Link>` on all clickable cards — `IssueRow` and `CommandCard` use `<a href>` with Ctrl+click passthrough; `Commands.tsx` adds `?open=:id` URL param support

### Schema — Single Source of Truth
- [x] Consolidate all migrations into `schema.sql` — folds org-v2, phase12, tasks, FlowForge/NTBilling, embedding additions into one idempotent file; `npx tsx db/setup.ts` produces a complete DB on fresh install
- [x] Add `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column to all tables (`projects`, `documents`, `issues`, `commands`, `releases`, `runbooks`, `tasks`, `users`) with `set_updated_at()` trigger; migration in `db/migrations/add_updated_at_and_embedding_status.ts`
- [x] Write `db/setup.ts` — single idempotent setup script that runs `schema.sql` then calls `runSeed()`; replaces the multi-script setup dance

### Data Integrity — Fix JSONB Race Conditions
- [x] Normalize `investigation_steps` into `issue_steps` table — schema added; migration script `db/migrations/normalize_issue_jsonb.ts`; all routes use new table
- [x] Normalize `notes` into `issue_notes` table — same; `POST /notes` is now a plain INSERT; `DELETE /notes/:id` is a row DELETE; no more JSONB race condition
- [x] Update `server/routes/issues.ts` to use new tables; GET list+detail join `issue_steps`/`issue_notes` with `json_agg`; client types unchanged (same response shape)

### Reliability — Embeddings & AI
- [x] Add `AbortController` with 30s timeout to all Ollama `fetch()` calls in `services/ai.ts` — prevents connection pool starvation on hung Ollama process
- [x] Replace fire-and-forget embed calls with tracked async — `embedding_status: 'pending'|'processing'|'done'|'failed'` column on `documents` and `issues`; `embedIssueAsync` updates status; status dot indicator in Documents list and preview panel
- [x] Add embedding retry endpoint `POST /api/documents/:id/reembed` and `POST /api/issues/:id/reembed` — allows manual repair of failed embeddings; "Re-embed" button shown in document preview panel when status is failed/pending

### Code Quality
- [x] Split `Issues.tsx` (1,318 lines) into: `IssuesList.tsx`, `IssueDetail.tsx`, `NewIssueModal.tsx`, `IssueRow.tsx`, `StepText.tsx`, `issueConstants.ts` — `Issues.tsx` root is now 63 lines
- [~] Replace manual SQL parameter index counting with `buildWhereClause` — utility exists in `server/lib/db.ts` but list routes use custom SQL (table aliases, tsv @@, IS NULL, namespace logic) that the simple equality utility can't replace without making code less readable; left as-is
- [x] Add `useCallback` + `useMemo` to `IssuesList` and `CommandsPage` — `toggleSelect`, `toggleSelectAll`, open count memoized; `selected`, `availableLangs`, update/delete/fav handlers wrapped
- [x] Add `AbortController` to debounced search inputs — `IssuesList` and `CommandsPage` cancel in-flight load on new search; `AbortError` silently swallowed
- [x] Add drag-and-drop bounds validation in `IssueDetail` — `onDrop` guards `splice(fromIdx,1)` with full bounds check
- [x] Add `<ErrorBoundary>` around each route in `App.tsx` — catches component crashes; shows "Something went wrong" with a reload button instead of blank white screen

### Search & Pagination
- [x] Make search result limit configurable — backend `?limit=N` (default 10, max 50); `GlobalSearch.tsx` passes limit, starts at 10, "Show more" button increments by 10 up to 50
- [x] Add request deduplication in `client/src/lib/api.ts` — in-flight map keyed by URL path; GET requests without a signal share the same promise; requests with signal (search/AbortController) bypass the cache

---

## Phase 15 — Design, Accessibility & Usability ✅ COMPLETE
> Baseline review scores: Design **6/10**, UI **4/10**, Usability **6/10**.

### Accessibility (A11y)
- [x] Add `aria-label` to all icon-only buttons (star/favorite toggle, delete, close ✕, mark-used ✓) — IssueDetail, IssueRow, CommandCard, CommandDetail, RunbookCard, NewIssueModal, ProjectModal, NewCommandModal, NewRunbookModal, GlobalSearch
- [x] Add `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + `aria-labelledby` to all modals — NewIssueModal, ProjectModal, NewCommandModal, NewRunbookModal, GlobalSearch, shortcuts modal; `aria-pressed` on toggle buttons
- [x] Fix `cursor: 'default'` on all `<button>` elements — global `cursor: pointer` in index.css; removed inline `cursor: 'default'` overrides
- [x] Add `tabIndex` and `onKeyDown` to all interactive card rows — IssueRow (`<a>` gets keyboard nav free), CommandCard (`<a>`), RunbookCard (div → `tabIndex={0}` + `onKeyDown` Enter/Space)
- [x] Add visible focus ring — `outline: 2px solid var(--accent)` on `:focus-visible` in index.css

### Responsive Layout
- [~] Make sidebar panels resizable — too complex for v1; deferred to Phase 22
- [x] Add responsive breakpoint at 900px — `@media (max-width: 900px)` in index.css; sidebar collapses to 56px, min touch targets 44px
- [x] Add mobile viewport meta tag and basic touch targets — already in `client/index.html`; 44px touch targets added

### URL-Driven State & Deep Links
- [~] Canonical URL per entity — uses `?open=:id` param which achieves same UX goal as path params
- [x] Add "Copy link" button on issue detail and command detail — copies `window.location.origin + /issues?open=:id` / `/commands?open=:id` to clipboard
- [x] Restore last-visited route and project from URL — already handled by React Router + `?project=` param (Phase 14)

### Design System Migration
- [x] Extract design tokens to `client/src/styles/tokens.css` — `:root {}` block + density/tint variants moved out of index.css; `@import './styles/tokens.css'` at top of index.css
- [~] Shared style constants `shared.ts` — too large a refactor for v1; deferred
- [x] Add enter/exit animations to modals — `modal-in` + `overlay-in` keyframes in index.css; `.modal-panel` / `.modal-overlay` classes applied to all dialogs

### Usability Improvements
- [x] Add runbook print/export view — `?print=1` URL param on RunbooksPage renders clean white print view; "⎙ Print" button opens in new tab from RunbookDetail
- [x] Increase ⌘K search to show 10 results by default + "show more" — done in Phase 14; verified
- [x] Add onboarding empty states — Issues (icon + CTA button), Commands (icon + CTA button), Documents (icon + helper text) all show helpful empty states
- [x] Add "recently viewed" trail — `useRecentlyViewed` hook in `client/src/hooks/`; tracked on IssueDetail + CommandDetail open; shown in Dashboard (section) and GlobalSearch (empty-query results)
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for primary actions — `N` opens new item on Issues, Commands, Runbooks pages; `G D/I/C/R` navigate to sections; shown in ? shortcuts modal

## Phase 18 — Claude Integration V2 ✅ COMPLETE

> Builds the DevBrain UI layer on top of the existing `integrations/claude-code/` hook foundation.
> Feature 3 (Sharing) scrapped. Build order: Curation schema → Discovery → Task Sync → Session Viewer.

### Design decisions
- Curation state stored in PostgreSQL (`claude_projects` table), not `~/.devbrain/projects.json`
- Scan root stored in `app_settings` (key: `claude_scan_root`), configurable from Settings UI
- No separate "Claude Projects" sidebar — discovered projects link to existing DevBrain projects via `fs_path` field
- Linked projects gain **Tasks** and **Sessions** tabs in project detail view
- File watcher covers all active + pinned projects simultaneously

### Step 1 — Curation Schema & API <!-- done: 2026-05-19 -->
- [x] Add `fs_path TEXT` column to `projects` table in `schema.sql` (nullable — not all projects have a linked path)
- [x] Add `claude_scan_root` key to `app_settings` defaults in `schema.sql`
- [x] Add `GET /api/settings/claude` and `PUT /api/settings/claude` endpoints in `settings.ts` — expose/update `claude_scan_root`
- [x] Add `PUT /api/projects/:id/link` endpoint — set/clear `fs_path` on a project; validate path exists on disk
- [x] Expose `fs_path` in `GET /api/projects` and `GET /api/projects/:id` responses

### Step 2 — Project Discovery <!-- done: 2026-05-19 -->
- [x] Add `gray-matter` to server deps (YAML frontmatter parser)
- [x] Write `server/services/claude-discovery.ts` — recursive scan up to 3 levels; qualify by CLAUDE.md / SESSION.md / TASKS.md; parse task completion %; auto-suggest project match by name similarity; cancellable via AbortController
- [x] Add `POST /api/claude-projects/scan` endpoint — runs discovery, returns candidates array
- [x] Update `integrations/claude-code/src/hooks/session-start.ps1` — per-phase summary in context block; 7-day archive sweep of completed tasks
- [x] Update `integrations/claude-code/src/skills/devbrain/SKILL.md` — append `<!-- done: YYYY-MM-DD -->` stamp when marking tasks complete
- [x] Define `TASKS_ARCHIVE.md` format: YAML frontmatter, sections grouped by phase, `archived_on` note per batch; append-only

### Step 3 — TASKS.md Sync <!-- done: 2026-05-19 -->
- [x] Add `chokidar` to server deps (file watcher)
- [x] Write `server/services/tasks-watcher.ts` — watch TASKS.md for all linked projects; parse on change; emit via SSE; debounce 300ms
- [x] Add `GET /api/claude-projects/:id/tasks` endpoint — return parsed task tree (phases + items + stats)
- [x] Add `GET /api/claude-projects/:id/tasks/watch` SSE endpoint — stream `task_update` events on file change
- [x] Client: `TasksTab.tsx` — phase accordion with completion bars; item rows with status markers; live SSE updates
- [x] Add Tasks tab to project detail view (only when `fs_path` is set)

### Step 4 — Session Viewer <!-- done: 2026-05-19 -->
- [x] Write `server/services/session-reader.ts` — scan SESSION.md files; parse frontmatter + sections; return structured summary + raw markdown
- [x] Add `GET /api/claude-projects/:id/sessions` — paginated, newest-first, `?status=` filter, `?q=` search
- [x] Add `GET /api/claude-projects/:id/sessions/:sessionId` — full session detail
- [x] Client: `SessionsTab.tsx` — timeline grouped by week; expandable session cards; filter bar; client-side search
- [x] Add Sessions tab to project detail view (only when `fs_path` is set)

### Step 5 — Discovery UI in Settings <!-- done: 2026-05-19 -->
- [x] Settings: "Claude Integration" section — scan root input + Save; "Scan Now" → results table with Link / Create / Ignore actions
- [x] Projects page: "Claude" chip badge on projects with `fs_path` set
- [x] Project detail: Tasks/Sessions tabs gated on `fs_path`; prompt to link folder when unset
